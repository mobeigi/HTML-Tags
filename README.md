TripTags Project
=========
**This was the project outcome for the SENG2021 course in Semester 2, 2014**


Everyone takes photographs on their trips, whether it is a short trip to the mall or a round the world adventure. Photographs are an integral component of everyone’s trips. It allows people to share memories and experiences with friends and family in a way words cannot describe. 
However, it is difficult to share ones experiences on a trip by showcasing images in an album. There is no connection between trip locations and images taken at a location.  This makes judging a tourist location difficult which can lead to misinterpretation of the area. 

Furthermore, there is currently no service that allow users to upload their photographic memories and display them as a timeline on an interactive map. This project will solve this problem and provide a simple and unique application for travellers to enjoy.
A visual representation of a trip can be displayed once a user groups their images into image groups which contain all photos taken in a particular region (like Sydney, Melbourne…etc). The user is then able to add meta-data such as geolocation information and a description to the image group. These image groups allow the journey to be visually displayed. Image groups (aka TripTags) will be placed on an interactive map (provided by a third party) and will be joint together using linear lines based on the order that trip locations were visited.
Upon clicking on an image group, an image viewer (Lightbox modal window) will appear allowing users to view all the images in that image group. Users are able to comment on images, view meta-data information and navigate to other image groups with the click of a button.

This application is targeted not only at people who travel frequently but people who love exploring their own cities and neighbourhoods. The social aspect of this application strongly appeals to such users. Users are able to view trips shared by friends and family as well as examine public trips to plan their next trip. They are also able to discuss trip destinations with different people from all around the world.
TripTags provides people with a unique and elegant application which allows them to share their trip images via an image viewer and their trip experiences via an interactive map.
