Melbourne is an excellent place to see the seasons change. In summer, most people head out to visit our golden beaches. In autumn, experience the glorious foliage of the many European-style parks that fringe the CBD.  In winter, Melburnians enjoy the warmth of cosy cafes and bars. Spring is a time for renewal – a great time to head back into our parks and revel in our beautiful gardens.
