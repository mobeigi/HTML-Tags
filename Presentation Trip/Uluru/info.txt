Uluru does not mean "waterhole", as you might have read. It is simply an Aboriginal place name, referring to both the rock itself and the waterhole on top of the rock.

Kata Tjuta (the other rock formation in the national park) does have a translation. It literally means "many heads".

The Aboriginal owners of Uluru call themselves Anangu, and ask you to do so, too. They are often referred to as the Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara people, Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara are actually the two languages spoken by the Anangu.
