Perth has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is the sunniest capital city in Australia with clear blue skies an incredible 70% of the year! Our warm weather and clean air allow us to enjoy a year-round outdoor lifestyle and we make the most of our State’s natural beauty. Our treasured coastline of white sandy beaches makes the ocean and the Swan River a big part of our lives and culture, and we work hard to maintain Western Australia’s unique national parks and gardens.
